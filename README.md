# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This repository showcases a collection of my personal machine learning projects that I have developed over time. Each project within this repository reflects my passion for data analytics and machine learning, and demonstrates my skills and experiences in these areas.

Inside this repository, you will find various projects, each contained in its own folder with a dedicated README file detailing the project's objectives, methodologies, and results. From prediction models to simulations, these projects highlight my journey and growth in the field of machine learning.

Feel free to explore the projects, review the code, and reach out if you have any questions or feedback!
