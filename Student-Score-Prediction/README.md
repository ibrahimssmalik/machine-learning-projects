# Student Score Prediction with Machine Learning Using Python

This is a simple linear regression involving two variables. In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task completed under my term as an intern at The Sparks Foundation.

## Project Overview

This project uses a Linear Regression to predict student scores. The repository contains three files:

1. `README.md`: Documentation of the project.
2. `student_scores.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
3. `student_prediction.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the Linear Regression model.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook student_scores.ipynb
    ```
2. Run the cells in the notebook to:
    - Load and preprocess the dataset
    - Train the model
    - Evaluate the model's performance
    - Make predictions

## Future Work

- Explore other machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for improved performance.
- Implement hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model.
- Expand the dataset with more features and records to increase the model's robustness.
